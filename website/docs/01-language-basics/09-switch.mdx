# Switch

Zig's `switch` works as both a statement and an expression. The types of all
branches must coerce to the type which is being switched upon. All possible
values must have an associated branch - values cannot be left out. Cases cannot
fall through to other branches.

An example of a switch statement. The else is required to satisfy the
exhaustiveness of this switch.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{SwitchStatement}</CodeBlock>

Here is the former, but as a switch expression.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{SwitchExpression}</CodeBlock>
